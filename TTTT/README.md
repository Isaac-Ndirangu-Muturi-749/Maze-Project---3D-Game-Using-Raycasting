Sure, let's start by organizing the code into separate modules. We'll create header files for declarations and source files for implementations. Here's a breakdown of how we can organize the code:

1. **player.c** and **player.h**: These files will contain the code related to player movement and properties.

2. **raycasting.c** and **raycasting.h**: Here, we'll put the functions related to ray casting, such as casting rays, finding intersections, and rendering walls.

3. **input.c** and **input.h**: This module will handle input processing, including keyboard events.

4. **map.c** and **map.h**: Functions for map rendering and collision detection will reside here.

5. **textures.c** and **textures.h**: Manage the loading and freeing of textures.

6. **window.c** and **window.h**: Code for window initialization, destruction, and color buffer management will be placed here.

7. **utilities.c** and **utilities.h**: This module will contain helper functions like drawing lines, rectangles, and calculating distances.

8. **main.c**: The main function will stay here, orchestrating the game loop.

Let's start by creating header files for each module and move the function prototypes accordingly. Then, we'll create the corresponding source files and implement the functions. Does that sound good?
